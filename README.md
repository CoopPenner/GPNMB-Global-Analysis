This is a collection of different approaches to parsing out how and whether GPNMB is a mediator of inflammation, many of the functions serve to organize and analyze outputs from Penn's INDD database

Cog Decline Comp serves to evaluate and plot differences in cognitive decline rates (or honestly any continuous variable) between different disease conditions and evals significance with a glme 

Collective GPNMB SNP Check serves to evaluate differences in allelic frequency across various disease conditions

fast SNP check: just a simple analysis using alternative SNPs

GPNMB Title Gen: generates titles, reformats for easier readability

snpPlotterGPNMB: generates scatter bars across different genotypes

snpPlotterGPNMB2: compares allelic frequency between different disease conditions
